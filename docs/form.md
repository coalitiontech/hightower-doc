# Forms — Create, Add in pages

## 1. Create a Form
1. WP admin → Forms → New Form. Give it a title and description.
2. Add fields (drag & drop) and configure field settings.
3. Configure Confirmations: Forms → your form → Settings → Confirmations.
4. Save the form and note the form ID (shown on the forms list or the form editor).

## 2. Add Form to a page
Create a dedicated WP page that contains only the form (use the shortcode: [gravityform id="X" title="false" description="false"]).
